    <p>My name is Amelio Wright, I am a person driven by ambition and desire to do awesome things.</p> 
    <p>I contantly set goals to challenge myself and go distances to reach the next level.</p>
    <p>My hobbies outside of developing awesome software solutions include working on and fixing old cars, experiencing food flavors from around the world, 
    collecting and sampling tea from across Asia, finding the best craft beers, scotch, and international liqours and writing a bit about them,  
    (attemping to learn) Mandarin Chinese, kung-fu movies, world history, slaying orcs in the land of Mordor, battling demons in Azeroth. I'd like to give flying lessons
    a go someday :).</p>
