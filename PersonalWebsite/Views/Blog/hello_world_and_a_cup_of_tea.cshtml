        <p>Hello world! I'd like to welcome you to my re-designed blog. This is my first attempt at using angularJS as the driving element to bind data to html elements.</p>
        <p>Most likely, my usage will evolve overtime as I learn through refactoring, but this is pretty exciting nonetheless.</p>
        <p>I will be using this space to share my views on current things that interest me, problems that I have experienced and overcome, and the sort.</p>
        <p>My goal is to publish atleast one article on here weekly to start and overtime as I become more assimilated with writing about things I'll hopefully get on to putting out more material.</p>
